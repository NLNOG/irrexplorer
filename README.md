The first version of IRR explorer was written by
[Job Snijders](https://github.com/job/irrexplorer) to make it easier to debug
data in the IRR system. An example is to verify whether you would be impacted
by deployment of filtering strategies such as "IRR Lockdown".

The original project has several issues, and this IRR explorer v2 project
is an improved reimplementation on top of [IRRd](https://github.com/irrdnet/irrd)
for [Stichting NLNOG](https://nlnog.net/) by [DashCare BV](https://dashcare.nl/).
